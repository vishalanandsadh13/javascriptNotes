What is a Variable?
A variable is a named placeholder that holds data or information. In simpler terms, variables are used to store values that can be used and manipulated throughout your code. Think of variables as containers that hold different types of data, such as text, numbers, or even more complex structures.

Why Use Variables?
Let's consider an e-commerce application where you need to add products to a wishlist or a cart. JavaScript needs to store the information about these products to manage them effectively. This is where variables come into play. By storing data in variables, you can easily reference and manipulate that data later in your code.

How to Create Variables
There are three main ways to declare variables in JavaScript: var, let, and const. Each has its own use case and scope rules.



Declaring Variables with var
The var keyword is used to declare a variable. Here's how you can create and use a variable with var:




var message;
message = "Hello, Geeks!";
console.log(message); // Outputs: Hello, Geeks!

Output
Hello, Geeks!
In the above example, we first declare a variable named message using var. We then assign the string "Hello, Geeks!" to it. Finally, we use console.log() to display the value of the message variable.

Declaring Variables with let
The let keyword is a more modern way to declare variables and is generally preferred over var due to its block-scoping feature.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

let text = "JavaScript is the best!";
console.log(text); // Outputs: JavaScript is the best!

Output
JavaScript is the best!
Here, we declare a variable named text and assign it the value "JavaScript is the best!". We then log the value of text to the console.

Declaring Variables with const
The const keyword is used to declare variables that are meant to be constants, meaning their values should not change once assigned.




const number = 10;
console.log(number); // Outputs: 10

Output
10
With const, you must assign a value at the time of declaration, and this value cannot be changed later in your code.

Variable Assignment and Re-assignment
Variables declared with var and let can be reassigned new values, while variables declared with const cannot.




var message = "Hello, Geeks!";
message = "Hello, GeeksforGeeks!";
console.log(message); // Outputs: Hello, GeeksforGeeks!
​
let text = "JavaScript is the best!";
text = "JavaScript is awesome!";
console.log(text); // Outputs: JavaScript is awesome!
​
const number = 10;
number = 20; // Error: Assignment to constant variable.

Output
Hello, GeeksforGeeks!
JavaScript is awesome!
Error : Assignment to constant variable.
Why Use let and const over var?
Block Scoping: let and const are block-scoped, meaning they are only accessible within the block they are defined. var is function-scoped, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
Re-assignment: const ensures that variables cannot be reassigned, which helps prevent accidental changes to important values.
