What is JavaScript ?

JavaScript is a versatile, dynamically typed programming language used for interactive web applications, supporting both client-side and server-side development, and integrating seamlessly with HTML, CSS, and a rich standard library.

* JavaScript is a single-threaded language that executes one task at a time.
* It is an Interpreted language which means it executes the code line by line.
* The data type of the variable is decided at run-time in JavaScript that’s why it is called dynamically typed.

Key Features of JavaScript-------
Here are some key features of JavaScript that make it a powerful language for web development:

Client-Side Scripting:JavaScript runs on the user's browser, so has a faster response time without needing to communicate with the server.
Versatile: JavaScript can be used for a wide range of tasks, from simple calculations to complex server-side applications.
Event-Driven: JavaScript can respond to user actions (clicks, keystrokes) in real-time.
Asynchronous: JavaScript can handle tasks like fetching data from servers without freezing the user interface.
Rich Ecosystem: There are numerous libraries and frameworks built on JavaScript, such as React, Angular, and Vue.js, which make development faster and more efficient.
Client Side and Server Side nature of JavaScript
JavaScript's flexibility extends to both the client-side and server-side, allowing developers to create complete web applications. Here’s how it functions in each environment:

Client-Side:

Involves controlling the browser and its DOM (Document Object Model).
Handles user events like clicks and form inputs.
Common libraries include AngularJS, ReactJS, and VueJS.
Server-Side:

Involves interacting with databases, manipulating files, and generating responses.
Node.js and frameworks like Express.js are widely used for server-side JavaScript, enabling full-stack development.
